# osu.NET

A wrapper of the osu!api v2. See the wiki of the api [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/docs/index.html).

Primarly written for personal projects but is publicly available for anyone to use.
Please report issues or feature suggestions in the [Issues](https://github.com/VolcanicArts/osu.NET/issues) section of the repository.

You can download the latest build through [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/volcanicarts.osu.NET/).

## Support

Documentation on the osu! wiki for the api is still being written but I aim to try and wrap it as best as possible.
Since the api is still currently being developed, breaking changes can occur at any time.

The current supported scopes and endpoints are listed below.
Bare in mind that even if an endpoint is supported it might not be fully implemented.

### Scopes
- Public

### Endpoints
- Get beatmap
- Get beatmapset
